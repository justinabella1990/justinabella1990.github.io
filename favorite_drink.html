    <p>Recently I have been drinking Sparkling Ice drinks. It's basically kind of like flavored sparkling water, but it uses artificial sweetener so the taste is stronger and better than other kinds I've had. It also works pretty well as a mixer for other drinks, which I guess is to be expected for sparkling water.</p>
